# Text_Editor

This project centers on developing a Java-based text editor with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. The text editor is designed to have a window (frame) containing a menu bar, consisting of two primary menus: "File" and "Edit."

**File Menu Features:**
1. New Window: Allows users to open a new text editor window.
2. Save File: Enables users to save the current text to a file.
3. Open File: Allows users to open an existing text file.

**Edit Menu Features:**
1. Cut: Cuts selected text to the clipboard.
2. Copy: Copies selected text to the clipboard.
3. Paste: Pastes text from the clipboard.
4. Select All: Selects all text in the editor.
5. Close: Closes the current text editor window.

The text editor employs a text area within the window to facilitate text input and editing. The project demo showcases a straightforward yet functional text editor created using Java Swing, offering users the ability to compose and modify text within the text area.
